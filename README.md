**Title:** Smart Contract Security Enhancement Protocol (SCSEP)  
**Author:** Bakare Zainab  
**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Standard Track  
**Category:** Core  
**Created:** 08-10-2025  
**Requires:** EIP-165

## Abstract
This proposal introduces the **Smart Contract Security Enhancement Protocol (SCSEP)**, a comprehensive framework that integrates automated security validation, runtime monitoring, and standardized threat response mechanisms into the Ethereum protocol. SCSEP establishes a mandatory security layer for smart contracts, utilizing blockchain-native detection systems and community-driven security standards.

---

## Motivation
Smart contract security remains one of Ethereum's most critical challenges. Current security measures rely heavily on manual auditing and external tools, leading to inconsistent protection across the ecosystem.  

SCSEP addresses this gap by implementing:
- Mandatory runtime security validation  
- Automated vulnerability detection  
- Standardized threat response protocols  
- Community-driven security standards registry  

---

## Specification

### Core Components

#### Security Validation Engine (SVE)
```solidity
interface ISecurityValidator {
    function validateContract(address contractAddr) external view returns (bytes32);
    function getSecurityScore(address contractAddr) external view returns (uint256);
    function reportVulnerability(address contractAddr, bytes calldata evidence) external;
}
```
### Runtime Monitor Protocol (RMP)
```solidity
interface IRuntimeMonitor {
    function monitorTransaction(bytes32 txHash) external;
    function getContractStatus(address contractAddr) external view returns (SecurityStatus);
    function triggerEmergencyProtocol(address contractAddr) external;
}

enum SecurityStatus {
    SECURE,
    MONITORED,
    COMPROMISED,
    UNKNOWN
}
```
### Community Standards Registry (CSR)
```solidity
interface IStandardsRegistry {
    function registerSecurityStandard(bytes32 standardId, string calldata description) external;
    function getActiveStandards() external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
    function proposeSecurityUpdate(bytes32 standardId, bytes calldata updateData) external;
}
```
